# Intermediate-SQL
In this course I learned how to filter, compare, and summarize data with SQL. Using aggregate functions, sorting, grouping, and how to present data neatly. With hands-on practice queries to analyze data using SQL code!

## Course Chapters
- **Chapter 1: Selecting Data:** In this first chapter, I learned how to query a films database and selected the data needed to answer questions about the movies and actors. I have also understod how SQL code is executed and formatted.

- **Chapter 2: Filtering Records:** I have Learned about how I can filter numerical and textual data with SQL. Filtering is an important use for this language. Also learned how to use new keywords and operators to help narrow down the query to get results that meet the desired criteria and gain a better understanding of NULL values and how to handle them.

- **Chapter 3: Aggregate Functions:** SQL allows to zoom in and out to better understand an entire dataset, its subsets, and its individual records. I have learned to summarize data using aggregate functions and perform basic arithmetic calculations inside queries to gain insights into what makes a successful film.

- **Chapter 4: Sorting and Grouping:** This final chapter I have learned how to sort and group data. helping to uncover critical business insights and identify trends and performance. hands-on experience to determine which films performed the best and how movie durations and budgets changed over time.
